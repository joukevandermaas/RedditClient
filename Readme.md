# A simple Reddit client for Windows Phone

The idea behind this client is that there are three
types of reddit posts:

1. Articles (think [/r/programming](http://reddit.com/r/programming))
2. Pictures/videos/music (including albums/playlists)
3. Discussions (think [/r/askreddit](http://reddit.com/r/askreddit))

I mostly visit 1 and 3, so those have to work really well in this app.
That is, it must be easy to:

1. Read articles, and to swap back and forth between the article and the
   comments.
2. Read comment threads, keep track of what level you're at and collapse deep
   threads.
